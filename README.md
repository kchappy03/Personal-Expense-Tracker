In the files attached above is all the code that someone would need to run our application.  And below I will describe all the steps required that are needed to install it.  
I will go through this summary of installation in such a way that someone with no experience would be able to figure it out.  Additionally, we encourage any recommendations and
suggestions.  If you are seeing this and are not attached to The Citadels Cyber and Computer Science's department please reach out and let us know. 

Process of Installation:

- Step 1: Download all files inside of this github repository.
- Step 2: Take all downloaded files and move them into one shared location.  It does not matter where this location is, whether it's in your downloads folder or in a folder
  you made specifically to test this out, however we do recommend that.  As long as all the files that are listed in this github repoistory are in the same file directory it
  will work as developed.  You can do this easier by using the Github app or linux commands to immediately copy and paste it over without struggle.
- Step 3: Open one of the files, we recommend starting at the login/signup page as it will allow a new user to get the full experience of what we designed. However, you are able
  to view certain pages without having to go through others if you would like to experiment or test out something else.
- Step 4: Just enjoy the app! It was designed with the intent to help college students breakdown and categorize their expenses.
